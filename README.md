# SmallAutomaticGarden1
I made a small automatic watering project to water a few herb plants on my balcony. I bought a kit online to obtain the sensors, motors and relay board. 

The code is all mine and written from scratch. Here is the code from the seller just to prove mine is different, https://github.com/WayinTop. I added a few interlocks such as a way to make sure the moisture sensor didn't fall out of the pot. If the sensor detects the soil is dry 5 times in a row it locks out that pump to prevent it from overwatering that plant and emptying out the water tank. I also plan to add a level sensor or level switch in the future. That code is written for proof of concept but has been commented out until it gets added.

I am currently only running two channels for two planters and I wanted to get this up and running before my vacation. If it was more than two channels I probably would have structured the code differently for readability and to scale it easier.
